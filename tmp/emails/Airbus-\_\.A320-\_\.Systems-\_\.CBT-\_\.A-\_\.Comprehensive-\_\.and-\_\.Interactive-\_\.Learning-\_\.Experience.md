CBT is a type of education that uses computers to provide an interactive instructional experience. CBT is seen as the primary mode of instruction and allows students to learn at their own pace and convenience[^4^]. CBT is widely used in aviation training as it offers many benefits, such as:
  
- Reducing training costs and time
- Enhancing retention and comprehension
- Providing feedback and assessment
- Adapting to different learning styles and needs
- Increasing motivation and interest

The Airbus A320 Systems CBT app is developed by Faraz Sheikh, a professional pilot with over 20 years of operational experience. The app is based on a unique whiteboard animation that keeps training interesting and enables cadets and pilots to visualize and see information in a more educative and better learning experience[^1^]. The app also allows students and pilots to add their own notes under each topic for making this into a reference guide and training package for later use.
  
The app is simple to use and requires no internet connection once downloaded. You can pause and play at any point to review and absorb information as you feel necessary. The app also includes quizzes at the end of each topic to test your knowledge and understanding. The app is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices running iOS 10.0 or later[^1^].
  
The app is available for purchase on the App Store for $34.99. You can also download a free trial version that covers the general introduction of the Airbus A320 systems. The app is for study reference only and should not be used for operation. Always refer to the official Airbus FCOM for operation.
  
If you are interested in learning more about the Airbus A320 systems in a fun and effective way, you should give the Airbus A320 Systems CBT app a try. It is one of the best tools for studying and preparing for your exams or refreshing your knowledge. You will not regret it!
  
## Why Choose the Airbus A320?
  
The Airbus A320 is not only a popular and versatile aircraft, but also a smart and efficient one. The A320 offers many benefits to airlines and passengers alike, such as:

- Unbeatable fuel efficiency: The A320neo (new engine option) versions feature enhanced aerodynamics and the latest-generation jet engines, resulting in significant reductions in fuel burned and lower emissions. The A320neo Family aircraft benefit from 20% fuel burn reduction when compared to previous-generation aircraft (and up to 30% for the A321XLR), along with additional flight range and lower noise levels[^2^].
- Operational commonality: The A320 shares the same fly-by-wire digital flight controls and cabin management systems with the other versions in Airbusâ single-aisle aircraft family. This commonality helps reduce the cost of pilot training and scheduling, while also lowering operations and maintenance costs[^4^]. The A320 also has a high degree of cross-crew qualification with Airbusâ widebody aircraft, allowing pilots to transition easily between different types of Airbus jetliners.
- Market adaptability: The A320 can serve a wide range of markets and routes, from low- to high-density flights, as well as longer-range transcontinental services. The A320 can be configured for different seating options, from 140 to 180 passengers, depending on the airlineâs needs and preferences. The A320 can also operate from short urban runways and remote high-altitude airports, thanks to its advanced performance capabilities[^2^].
